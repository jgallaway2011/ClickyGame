# Welcome to Clicky Game: Traveler Edition!
React App Memory Game
Clicky Game is a simple react app memory game. The users goal is click all images once without clicking each moe than one time. Enjoy!

## Clicky Game will:
* Shuffle images once any image is clicked
* Add one to score when an image is clicked for the first time in that game session
* Keep track of the current users high score
* Notify user that game has ended when image clicked for a second time before clicking all others one time
* Notify user when they have won
* Reset game when user has either lost or won

## Future Development Work
* Issue with game not resetting properly when user has one.  They have to click two times to rest the game currently as opposed to one time!
